                        <li>Started the internship by studying for the AZ-900 fundementals exam. Passed the exam to earn
                            a certificate. This taught me the basics of DevOps and the infrastructure built behind the
                            code that we will eventually build.</li>
                        <li>Worked alongside a team to determine the scope and minimum requirements of a project.</li>
                        <li>The project was to build a customer-facing portal for Honeywell Adminstrators to uplaods and
                            clients to download firmware. This firmware can be for scanners, printers, etc.</li>
                        <li>Created a Azure Kubernetes cluster, PosgreSQL, storage account, and set up the CI/CD
                            pipeline that our code would eventually be running on.</li>
                        <li>Proposed a Database Schema that held the software, version, user, and adminstrators
                            information. This would be done through the use of Primary, Foreign keys and triggers.</li>
                        <li>Created an interactive UI using ReactJS with Honeywell Forge Library and Semantic UI, used
                            React Hooks for navigation
                            and functionality, and Axios library for API calls</li>
                        <li>The website had an additional search and filter feature for quicker navigation. I was the
                            one to create both the frontend functinoality and the algorithim in which the search and
                            filter would be implemented.</li>
                        <li>
                            Connected the Backend to Azure blob storage using connection strings and Blob Client
                            Service to upload and delete
                            files in the storage account
                        </li>
                        <li>Used the Agile methodology and collaboration software such as Jira, Bitbucket, and
                            Confluence.</li>
