                            <p>I am originally from Egypt. I was born August 1st 2002 in Sharkia, Egypt. I stayed in
                                Egypt until August of 2012, then my family made the big decision to move to the United
                                states. This was a tough decision and drastically impacted my future. My family and I
                                were only supposed to stay in the United States for three years. However, we ended up
                                staying for four years. My dad's company decided that he needed to go back and work in
                                Egypt. This would be an issue for me because I had grown accustomed to life in the
                                United States. The school cirriculmn was different, and life in Egypt was not good at
                                the time. The second big decision came. I would stay at a boarding school starting at
                                the age of 14 and would complete highscool there. While this might have been difficult
                                for me and my parents, it made it really easy to get into college in the United States.
                                I am now at Texas A&M studying Computer Science!

                            <p>I started my tennis career when coming to the United States. At first I started playing
                                becuase my older brother, ahmed, started playing highscool tennis. I started practicing
                                a couple of days a week with some highschooler as a tennis coach. While I would practice
                                a couple of times a week, that slowey grew into almost every single day in the week. I
                                would travel around the entirety of Texas, playing tournements. I would eventually
                                become Rank #23 in Texas! As I mentioned before, I went to a boarding school. The reason
                                I went to St. Stephens Episcopal because it was kind of a tennis school. There was a
                                very good tennis affiliated with the school, therefore, my tennis career developed there
                                a lot. While I wanted to go play tennis in college, in my opinion, I made the smarter
                                decision to persue academics and take it as more of a hobby. However, I still play
                                tennis regulary and am part of the Club tennis on campus. In which we travel and play
                                all around the nation against other univeristy club teams.</p>
