                                Some of these workshops have been: </li>
                            <li>Git workshops to teach students, mostly incoming freshman, what Git is and why everyone
                                uses it. Furthermore, there were multiple demos on how to push, pull, commit, and even
                                fix merge conlicts.</li>

                            <li>React workshops where I introduce the basics of react such as React fucntions and
                                properties. From there we go on to make a small project to test our knowledge of the
                                elements we just learned.</li>
                            <li>As treasurer I manage the organizations fiainces and create the budget. This budget is

                                soon realized that competitve programming was tougher and a much more developed
                                community than I came to expect.</li>
                            <li>Participated in programming compition that has multiple questions ranging from easy to
                                difficult. These competitions usually lasted around 4 hours.</li>
